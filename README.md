## 🤔Problems in Real Lifes
* **Conventional Business Process Consumes Too Much Time** (The screening and negotiation process takes a long time, so customers become hesitant and tend not to sell their cars)
* **Lack of Trust from Customers due to Staff’s Subjectivity** (The company determines the purchase price of a used car is not standard (not in accordance with the actual condition of the car) so that the price of a used car is determined from a biased perspective by each staff)

## 📝Goal & Objective
* To build machine learning models to determine the selling price of a car that can be standardized using some variables or features of the car's actual condition.

## 🖋 About Project
*   This repository contains files to create Machine Learning Model to Predict Car Price using Jupyter Notebook and the dataset from Kaggle
*   The steps taken consist of: 
    - Check the dataset
    - Data Cleansing
    - Explotary Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Feature Selection, Feature Engineering and Data Preparation for Modelling
    - Regression Modelling and Evaluation
*   After doing these steps, the results of the machine learning model using several types of regression are:

## ⭐ Conclusion
*   Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor is the model I will choose since it has the highest CV score(92%) which mean it generalize better than other models.
*   Linear model is also a great model choice if we have computational power constraint since the non-linear model are quite computational expensive.
